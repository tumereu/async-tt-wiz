# arcanum-api

Card definition models shared by `arcanum-parser` and `arcanum-engine`: a typed
description of what a card's abilities do. Definitions can be produced by the
parser, written to files and loaded without it, or written by hand. No game state
lives here. Design: `docs/specs/arcanum-automatum.md` §4.1 and §5.

## Contents

The definition model (overview in `Definitions.kt`):

- `CardDefinition(layout, faces)`; `FaceDefinition`: name, mana cost, colour
  indicator, supertypes/types/subtypes, P/T, loyalty, defense, abilities.
- `Ability`: `Spell`, `Activated`, `Triggered`, `Static` (the CR kinds), `Keyword`,
  `Unparsed`. Spell/activated/triggered carry `Instructions` (targets, modes,
  `Step`s of one-shot `Effect`s); static abilities carry `Mechanic`s.
- `Effect` (one-shot, CR 610) vs `Mechanic` (continuous, CR 611): each mechanic
  states its layer and how duplicates combine (`Stacking`: redundant, additive,
  independent). `Effect.ApplyMechanics` creates a continuous effect with a
  `Duration`.
- `Keyword`: one sealed type per keyword with exactly its values; `KeywordKind`
  names a keyword without values for filters ("creatures with flying").
  `KeywordExpansions` is the shared table mapping keywords to abilities built from
  mechanics (flying → `CantBeBlocked`, deathtouch → `Deathtouch`).
  Mechanics that are only a keyword's meaning are `Mechanic.KeywordOnly` and
  appear only there; `DefinitionChecks.problems` reports them in definitions.
- Building blocks: `Cost`/`CostPart`, `Trigger`/`EventPattern`, `Objects`/
  `ObjectFilter`, `Players`/`PlayerFilter`, `Value`, `Condition`, `Duration`,
  `ManaProduction`, `TokenSpec`, `KeywordAction`.
- `ManaCost`/`ManaSymbol` (CR 107.4), `Color`, and basic vocabularies (`CardType`,
  `Zone`, `TurnStep`, `CounterKind`, `Status`, …).
- `ComprehensiveRules.EFFECTIVE_DATE`: the pinned rules version (2026-09-25).

`ExampleCardsTest` shows a dozen invented cards written in the model and their
JSON. Decisions from the API review (D19–D24: Stack items and effect objects with
ids, object identity, ledgers, the object model) are not built here yet.
Types are sealed hierarchies rather than enums with values (owner preference).

## Rules

- Generic MTG code: no dependency on any ATW module (`verifyModuleBoundaries`).
- Kotlin Multiplatform common code only.
